**Feeding conflict? New data on the impact of humanitarian food aid on civil conflict** [\[Link to paper\]]({% link files/Feeding_conflict.pdf %}). 

Does humanitarian food aid increase violent conflict? Previous measures of humanitarian food aid suffer from two problems: (1) they fail to account for differences in within-country transportation costs and (2) they conflate humanitarian and nonhumanitarian food aid. I introduce a new dataset of USAID humanitarian food assistance across 103 countries from 1991 to 2019 which resolves these problems. I exclude shipping costs by using tonnage of food commodities and isolate the humanitarian portions of USAID's food assistance. I find no relation between humanitarian food assistance and the incidence of civil conflict. I also find that humanitarian food aid does not affect conflict termination or the duration of peace. These results do not change when I use these new data to proxy for the ease of appropriating humanitarian aid. By introducing new program-level data, this paper provides evidence on a disputed linkage and advances the literature on the unintended consequences of humanitarian assistance.

**Who wants property rights? Conjoint evidence from Senegal** [\[Link to paper\]](https://steg.cepr.org/sites/default/files/2023-07/WP072%20RibarWhoWantsPropertyRights.pdf)

Why don’t more farmers formalize their land rights? Previous research assumes that households will avail themselves of formal land titles when they are able. The hypothesized benefit of land titling is increase tenure security, but where households lack confidence in state institutions, they may not believe that land titles will be advantageous in reducing expropriation. I use a field conjoint experiment of 1,164 household heads across rural Senegal to understand which attributes affect the perceived likelihood of winning a land dispute. Land titles increase the likelihood of winning a perceived land dispute for all respondents, but the effect is weaker for those who lack confidence in formal institutions. Social proximity to customary elites does not affect these results. A structural topic model shows that where formal titles are not a deciding factors, respondents discuss improvements made to the land when considering potential land disputes. Taken together, this paper shows how external attributes affect households’ confidence of winning land disputes and their eventual take-up of formal land titles. 

**Negotiation training, participation in community development, and support for violent extremism: experimental evidence from Niger [with Ryan Sheely and Kathryn M. Lance].**

The 'Youth Connect' (YC) program in Niger provides community development projects and access to market resources to households in the Maradi and Tillaberi regions of Niger. However, youth are traditionally excluded from decision making at the village level, despite being the most vulnerable group to violent extremism. We randomly assign 'interest-based negotiation' training to half of the villages which received the main YC treatment. This training may better allow youth to participate in discussions with the villager leaders, increasing youth buy-in and making the projects themselves more likely to reflect youth needs. We hypothesize that bundling the main intervention and the negotiation training will have a 'multiplier' effect in reducing support for violent extremism. 

**Measuring and Explaining Support for Violent Extremism: Evidence from Niger and Burkina Faso [with Ryan Sheely and Adam Lichtenheld].**

Violent extremist organizations (VEOs) in the Sahel region have expanded their influence and escalated attacks against civilians and local security forces. This paper introduces an original survey on support for violent extremism among youth in Niger and Burkina Faso. We use a combination of direct and indirect measures - including list and endorsement experiments - to identify levels of support. We also leverage a unique set of self-reported village-level rankings by local elites to examine how well these factors predict support for violent extremism, along with the incidence of violent events perpetrated by extremist groups, according to ACLED. Together, this data allows us to 1) provide insight into validly and reliably measuring violent extremism - a challenge for scholars and policymakers - and 2) the extent to which individual- and community-level political, economic, and social factors are associated with increased vulnerability to violent extremism.
