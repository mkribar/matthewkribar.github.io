**Negotiation training, participation in community development, and support for violent extremism: experimental evidence from Niger [with Ryan Sheely and Adam Lichtenheld].**

- The 'Youth Connect' (YC) program in Niger provides community development projects and access to market resources to households in the Maradi and Tillaberi regions of Niger. However, youth are traditionally excluded from decision making at the village level, despite being the most vulnerable group to violent extremism. We randomly assign 'interest-based negotiation' training to half of the villages which received the main YC treatment. This training may better allow youth to participate in discussions with the villager leaders, increasing youth buy-in and making the projects themselves more likely to reflect youth needs. We hypothesize that bundling the main intervention and the negotiation training will have a 'multiplier' effect in reducing support for violent extremism. 

**Measuring and Explaining Support for Violent Extremism: Evidence from Niger and Burkina Faso [with Ryan Sheely and Adam Lichtenheld].**

- Violent extremist organizations (VEOs) in the Sahel region have expanded their influence and escalated attacks against civilians and local security forces. This paper introduces an original survey on support for violent extremism among youth in Niger and Burkina Faso. We use a combination of direct and indirect measures - including list and endorsement experiments - to identify levels of support. We also leverage a unique set of self-reported village-level rankings by local elites to examine how well these factors predict support for violent extremism, along with the incidence of violent events perpetrated by extremist groups, according to ACLED. Together, this data allows us to 1) provide insight into validly and reliably measuring violent extremism - a challenge for scholars and policymakers - and 2) the extent to which individual- and community-level political, economic, and social factors are associated with increased vulnerability to violent extremism.

**Feeding conflict? New data on the impact of humanitarian food aid on civil conflict**

- Does humanitarian food aid prolong violent conflict? Previous measures of humanitarian food aid suffer from two problems: (1) they fail to account for differences in within-country transportation costs and (2) they conflate humanitarian and non-humanitarian food aid. I introduce a new dataset of USAID humanitarian food assistance across 103 countries from 1991 to 2019 which resolves these problems. I exclude shipping costs by using tonnage of food commodities and isolate the humanitarian portions of USAID's food assistance. I find no relation between humanitarian food assistance and the incidence of civil conflict. I also find that humanitarian food aid does not affect conflict termination or the duration of peace. By introducing new program-level data, this paper provides evidence on a disputed linkage and advances the literature on the unintended consequences of humanitarian assistance.
